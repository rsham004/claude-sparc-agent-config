- 🎨 UX Design Document with component specifications
- 📋 Implementation Plan with phased approach
- 🧪 TDD-Guard validation requirements

**Instructions:**

### 1. **🔍 Pre-Implementation Analysis**
- **Document Review:** Analyze all design documents for implementation requirements
- **Technology Validation:** Verify all dependencies against technology-lock.json
- **Test Strategy Planning:** Define comprehensive test coverage approach
- **YOLO Protocol Alignment:** Ensure implementation follows YOLO delivery standards

### 2. **🧪 TDD-Guard Integration Setup**
- **Test Framework Configuration:** Set up testing infrastructure before any code
- **TDD-Guard Activation:** Configure automatic test-first enforcement
- **Quality Gates:** Implement automated quality validation at each step
- **Red-Green-Refactor Enforcement:** Strict adherence to TDD cycle

### 3. **📊 YOLO Protocol Implementation**
- **Feature Decomposition:** Break implementation into maximum 7 features per EPIC
- **Issue Creation:** Maximum 3 issues per feature with GitHub integration
- **Incremental Delivery:** Implement one feature at a time with CI/CD
- **Automated Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive tracking and validation

### 4. **💻 Code Implementation Process**
- **Test-First Development:** Write failing tests before any implementation code
- **Minimal Implementation:** Write only enough code to pass tests
- **Continuous Refactoring:** Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
- **Documentation Integration:** Code documentation aligned with design specs

### 5. **🔒 Quality Enforcement**
- **Code Review Standards:** Implement peer review requirements
- **Security Validation:** Security-first coding practices
- **Performance Optimization:** Meet performance targets from architecture guide
- **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA standard implementation

**Deliverable:** 🟤 Production-Ready Codebase with Complete Test Suite
