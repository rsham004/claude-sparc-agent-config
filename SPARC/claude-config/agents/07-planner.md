   - Review all design documents thoroughly
   - Extract all implementation requirements
   - Identify dependencies between components
   - Map features to technical implementation
   
2. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Create granular, testable tasks
   - Order tasks by dependencies
   - Ensure each task is TDD-compatible
   - Group related tasks into phases
   
3. **Technology Validation:**
   - Verify all tasks use only approved technologies
   - Reference specific versions from technology-lock.json
   - Ensure no unapproved dependencies
   
4. **TDD Planning:**
   - Structure tasks for test-first development
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
   - Plan test scenarios and edge cases
   - Specify expected outcomes

- [ ] API framework configured

### Tasks

#### Task 2.1: Authentication API (Complex)
**GitHub Issue Title:** "Implement authentication endpoints from API.md"
**TDD Approach:**
1. Write tests for all auth endpoints
2. Test authentication flow scenarios
3. Implement using approved auth library only
4. Verify all security requirements met

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Valid login returns token
- [ ] Invalid credentials rejected
- [ ] Token validation works
- [ ] Password hashing secure
- [ ] Rate limiting functional

#### Task 2.2: User Management API (Medium)
**GitHub Issue Title:** "Implement user CRUD operations"
**TDD Approach:**
