## 1. Workflow Sequence Enforcement

### Mandatory Agent Order:
```
1. Product Manager → PRD.md
2. Solution Architect → SA.md + technology-lock.json
3. Context7 Enforcer → /approved-docs/
4. Data Architect → DA.md
5. API Developer → API.md
6. UX Designer → UX.md
7. Planner → code-plan.md
8. Coder TDD → Implementation
```

### Enforcement Rules:
- **NO agent can proceed without predecessor completion**
- **ALL outputs must be approved before next agent**
- **NO skipping or parallel execution without explicit approval**

### Violation Response:
```bash
WORKFLOW VIOLATION DETECTED
Agent: [agent-name]
Violation: Attempted to proceed without prerequisite completion
Required: [prerequisite-agent] must complete [required-output]
Action: HALT all activities until compliance restored
```

---

## 2. Technology Stack Enforcement

### Monitoring Activities:
- File modification scanning
- Import/require statement analysis
- Package.json/requirements.txt changes
- CDN link detection
- External library usage

### Technology Validation Process:
```bash
# Continuous scanning
for file in $(find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py"); do
  python /claude-config/scripts/validate-tech-stack.py \
    --file "$file" \
    --tech-lock technology-lock.json \
    --strict-mode
done
```

### Violation Matrix:
| Violation Type | Severity | Response |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Unapproved import | CRITICAL | Immediate halt + Issue creation |
| Version mismatch | HIGH | Block commit + Architecture review |
| External CDN | HIGH | Remove + Provide approved alternative |
| Package addition | CRITICAL | Revert + Solution architect approval |
| Documentation breach | MEDIUM | Redirect to /approved-docs/ |

### Enforcement Actions:
```bash
# CRITICAL VIOLATION
gh issue create --title "🚨 CRITICAL TECH VIOLATION" \
                --label "critical,violation,tech-compliance" \
                --body "**VIOLATION DETECTED**
Type: [violation-type]
File: [file-path]
Line: [line-number]
Unauthorized: [technology-name]
Approved Alternative: [alternative-from-lock]

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. Remove unauthorized technology
2. Replace with approved alternative
3. Update all related code
4. Verify with tech validator

**NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT UNTIL RESOLVED**"

# HALT CURRENT OPERATIONS
echo "COMPLIANCE VIOLATION - ALL DEVELOPMENT HALTED" > .enforcement-lock
```

---

## 3. TDD Process Enforcement

### Mandatory TDD Sequence:
1. Write failing test FIRST
2. Verify RED state with TDD-Guard
3. Write minimal implementation
4. Verify GREEN state with TDD-Guard
5. Refactor while maintaining GREEN
6. Commit with issue reference

### Monitoring Points:
- Test file creation before implementation
- TDD-Guard status verification
- Commit message validation
- Test coverage measurement

### TDD Violations:
```bash
# Monitor for code-first violations
if [[ -f "src/component.js" && ! -f "test/component.test.js" ]]; then
  echo "TDD VIOLATION: Implementation before test"
  gh issue create --title "🚨 TDD VIOLATION: Code before test"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify TDD-Guard compliance
tdd-guard status || {
  echo "TDD-Guard not in GREEN state"
  gh issue create --title "🚨 TDD STATE VIOLATION"
  exit 1
}
```

---

## 4. GitHub Integration Enforcement

### Mandatory GitHub Activities:
- Issue creation for every task
- Commit messages with issue references
- Problem tracking via issues
- Pull request for feature branches
- Issue closure on completion

### GitHub Compliance Check:
```bash
# Verify GitHub authentication
gh auth status || {
  echo "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
  exit 1
}

# Check for orphaned commits (no issue reference)
git log --oneline --grep="^(?!.*#[0-9]+)" --perl-regexp || {
  echo "Commits without issue references detected"
  gh issue create --title "🚨 GITHUB INTEGRATION VIOLATION"
}

# Verify issue tracking
open_issues=$(gh issue list --state open --json number | jq length)
if [[ $open_issues -eq 0 && $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "Work in progress without GitHub issues"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

## 5. Documentation Compliance

### Approved Documentation Sources:
- `/approved-docs/` (EXCLUSIVE source)
- technology-lock.json specifications
- Agent configuration files

### Prohibited Sources:
- External documentation websites
- Unofficial examples
- Stack Overflow (without verification)
- Outdated tutorials
- Non-approved versions

### Documentation Monitoring:
```bash
# Monitor for external documentation access
netstat -an | grep :80 | grep ESTABLISHED && {
  echo "WARNING: External web access detected during development"
  # Log and investigate
}

# Verify documentation references
grep -r "https://" src/ | grep -v "approved-docs" && {
  echo "External documentation references found"
  gh issue create --title "📚 DOCUMENTATION VIOLATION"
}
```

## 7. Violation Remediation Process

### Severity Levels:

#### CRITICAL (Development Halt)
- Unapproved technology usage
- TDD process bypass
- Missing GitHub integration
- **Action:** Immediate halt, mandatory remediation

#### HIGH (Warning + Block)
- Version mismatches
- External documentation usage
- Missing tests
- **Action:** Block progression, require fixes

#### MEDIUM (Warning + Log)
- Incomplete documentation
- Minor workflow deviations
- **Action:** Log violation, continue with warning

### Remediation Steps:
1. **Identify Root Cause**
2. **Create Remediation Issue**
3. **Implement Approved Solution**
4. **Verify Compliance Restoration**
5. **Update Monitoring Rules**

## 8. Emergency Procedures

### Architecture Review Escalation:
```bash
gh issue create --title "🆘 EMERGENCY ARCHITECTURE REVIEW" \
                --label "emergency,architecture" \
                --assignee [solution-architect] \
                --body "CRITICAL SITUATION REQUIRING ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

**Issue:** [description]
**Impact:** [scope of impact]
**Proposed Solution:** [if any]
**Urgency:** [timeline requirements]

**Current Status:**
- Development: HALTED
- Compliance: VIOLATED
- Required: Immediate architecture decision"
```

### Compliance Override (RESTRICTED):
```bash
# Only solution architect can authorize
echo "COMPLIANCE OVERRIDE AUTHORIZED" > .enforcement-override
echo "Authorized by: [architect-name]" >> .enforcement-override
echo "Timestamp: $(date)" >> .enforcement-override
echo "Reason: [justification]" >> .enforcement-override
```

## 9. Reporting and Analytics

### Daily Compliance Report:
```markdown
# Daily Compliance Report - [DATE]

## Workflow Progress
- [x] Agent sequence adherence: COMPLIANT
- [x] Output validation: COMPLIANT
- [ ] Technology enforcement: 2 violations resolved

## Technology Compliance
- Total scans: 156
- Violations detected: 3
- Violations resolved: 3
- Current status: COMPLIANT

## TDD Metrics
