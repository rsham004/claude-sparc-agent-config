**SPARC** (Structured Product Architecture Requirement Creation) is a comprehensive development framework created by the **ProductFoundry.ai** community for building high-quality software through structured agent workflows and test-driven development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsham004/claude-sparc-agent-config.git
cd claude-sparc-agent-config
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Interactive setup
./setup-sparc-project.sh

# Or specify project name directly
./setup-sparc-project.sh my-amazing-project
```

### 3. Start Building
```bash
# Begin with the Product Manager agent
claude "Execute Product Manager agent to create PRD for my project idea"
```

## 🎨 Color-Coded Agent System

Following **Claude Code best practices**, each agent has a unique color for easy identification:

| Color | Agent | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🔵 **Blue** | Product Manager | Foundation & Strategy |
| 🟠 **Orange** | Solution Architect | Architecture & Technical Foundation |
| 🟣 **Purple** | UX Designer | User Experience & Interface Design |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Visual Style Specialist | Creative & Visual Design |
| 🟢 **Green** | Data Architect | Data & Database Design |
| 🔴 **Red** | Senior API Developer | API Development & Backend Logic |
| ⚫ **Black** | Project Planner | Implementation Planning & Coordination |
| 🟤 **Brown** | Prompt Engineer | AI Optimization & Enhancement |
