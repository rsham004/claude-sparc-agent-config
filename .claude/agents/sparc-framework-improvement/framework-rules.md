- 📋 ALL violations MUST create Git issues automatically
- 🧪 TDD-Guard validation required for all code changes
- 🔒 Technology lock compliance mandatory
- 📝 Complete documentation required at each phase

## Import Main Framework
@../../../CLAUDE.md

## Framework Testing Loop
1. Identify issues/improvements from cafe-website testing
2. Design improvements using SPARC methodology
3. Implement improvements in framework
4. Test improvements against cafe-website project
5. Document learnings and iterate

## Next Steps
