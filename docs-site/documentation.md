## 🎨 Color-Coded Agent System

Following **Claude Code best practices**, each agent has a unique color for easy identification:

| Color | Agent | Purpose | Phase |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| 🔵 **Blue** | Product Manager | Foundation & Strategy | 1 |
| 🟠 **Orange** | Solution Architect | Architecture & Technical Foundation | 2 |
| 🟣 **Purple** | UX Designer | User Experience & Interface Design | 3 |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Visual Style Specialist | Creative & Visual Design | 4 |
| 🟢 **Green** | Data Architect | Data & Database Design | 5 |
| 🔴 **Red** | Senior API Developer | API Development & Backend Logic | 6 |
| ⚫ **Black** | Project Planner | Implementation Planning & Coordination | 7 |
| 🟤 **Brown** | Prompt Engineer | AI Optimization & Enhancement | As needed |

## 🔄 SPARC Workflow

### Phase 0: Project Setup
- ✅ **Automated Installation** - Project structure and agent setup
- ✅ **Environment Validation** - Claude Code, Git, and dependencies
- ✅ **Git Issue Integration** - Automatic tracking setup

### Phase 1: Design & Architecture
1. 🔵 **Product Manager** → Generate comprehensive PRD
2. 🟠 **Solution Architect** → Design technical architecture
3. 🟣 **UX Designer** → Create interface designs
4. 🟡 **Visual Style Specialist** → Generate visual concepts
